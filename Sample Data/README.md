# Data Directory README

This directory is structured to provide **sample data** related to our primary experimentations, as detailed in our paper.

## Directory Structure

- **International Data**: This folder contains data for the international classifications.
  
- **AE Data**: Contains sample data specifically for the classifications related to the AE locations.
  
- **GR Data**: This folder includes sample data related to GR classifications.

All the above datasets are formatted for immediate use with our `model.py` script.

- **DE-NL-BE-LU Data**: Sample data for DE, NL, BE, and LU are presented in the two `smsloc` files. Due to the large data size, additional metadata (not needed for classification) have been included to enhance the data comprehension. To use these files for classification, you will have to remove the redundant data and select the SMS transmissions you want to focus on only.

## Understanding the Data

Refer to the paper for more details related to the properties of each classification task.
